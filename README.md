# Runtastic

To start with the challenge, I attempted to Parse the available JSON data so that they match the required appearance.

During this I came across an issue regarding the parser as it allowed me to print the whole JSON file on the App; however, through some further tinkering, did not allow me to print it out in the demonstrated way on the challenge (such as found on a JSON viewer, structured).

I had to now figure out how I was going to display not just the data of each of the 'people', I had to properly display the groups, which led me onto trying to parse the 3 gorups.

I am aware that I got stuck on Challenge number 1 and that this presents an issue for a possible Internship. I must admit, that the challenge caught me off guard and had me working outside of my comfort zone, but I loved every minute of it! Thank you for that opportunity!

Thank you again for considering me for this challenge,

Georg Zsolnai
